						Marketing automation is the process of automating certain
						marketing workflows, allowing adaptive software to strategically
						use customer data to reach out to new and existing customers.
						Corporate marketing teams use marketing automation tools for
						many tasks. These include:<br/><br/>
						1. Email marketing campaigns: Marketing automation software can
						generate certain email campaigns as part of an outbound
						marketing strategy.<br/>
						2. Lead nurturing: Marketing software can execute strategies
						like lead scoring, segmentation, and drip marketing campaigns
						where users receive steady outreach through marketing channels
						to build up trust and familiarity with the company. This can
						turn qualified leads into paying customers.<br/>
						3. Lead management: A common marketing automation workflow
						involves tracking potential customers who leave items in their
						shopping carts. Through email marketing automation, these likely
						customers receive gentle notifications about their shopping
						carts and a suggestion that they complete the purchase.<br/>
						4. Search engine optimization: SEO contributes heavily to
						inbound marketing and lead generation in today’s digital
						economy. All companies, but small businesses in particular, need
						website landing pages that show up in search engine results.
						Automated marketing tools can help adjust landing page content
						by studying real-time search engine metrics.<br/>
						5. Social media management: Marketing automation software can
						handle some of the more tedious marketing tasks associated with
						social media campaigns. These marketing tools can automatically
						schedule social media posts, streamline social media messaging,
						and conduct “social listening” campaigns to see who’s talking
						about your brand on social media.<br/>
						6. Analytics: Last but not least, marketing automation platforms
						provide real-time data about your marketing campaigns and
						customer interactions. They help with attribution (tracing a
						customer journey back to a referring website), dynamic pricing,
						A/B testing of particular ads, and sales data.

					<h4 class="QnA--heading">How Does Marketing Automation Work?</h4>
				</div>
				<div class="QnA--normal" style="display: block">
					<p>
						In most cases, marketing automation software works in tandem
						with customer relationship management software, commonly
						abbreviated as CRM. All aspects of a customer lifecycle get
						tracked within a CRM. This includes initial attribution, email
						campaign outreach, sales cycles, customer support, and various
						other touchpoints related to the customer experience.<br/><br/>
						
						CRM integration enhances the functionality of marketing
						automation software. The CRM software contains past
						transactional data and possible notes about a customer added by
						sales team members. By sharing this data with marketing
						automation software, you can generate customized campaigns that
						target a customer’s core interests and increase the likelihood
						of a sale.

					<h4 class="QnA--heading">4 Benefits of Marketing Automation</h4>
				</div>
				<div class="QnA--normal" style="display: block">
					<p>
						Marketing automation software provides many benefits to users,
						including:<br/><br/>
						1. Time-saving automation features: Marketing automation
						software spares marketing teams the drudgery of sending emails,
						scheduling social media posts, and other tedious marketing
						tasks.<br/>
						2. Generation of relevant content: By leveraging customer data
						from your CRM software, a marketing automation platform can send
						individual customers their own custom-tailored messages. This
						might mean follow-up messages about an abandoned eCommerce
						shopping cart, or it might mean providing useful information to
						email list subscribers.<br/>
						3. An abundance of data and analytics: Automated marketing
						platforms provide their clients with an abundance of data about
						customer behavior, spanning from email open rates to ad clicks
						to time spent on a website to sales history. If you need data on
						your customers, marketing automation software is a great way to
						glean it.<br/>
						4. Comparatively affordable when contrasted with a team of human
						marketers: Marketing automation software can come with high
						upfront costs, particularly for business-to-business companies
						(B2B companies) that need B2B marketing automation. Yet over the
						long run, companies can save a lot of money by turning certain
						marketing processes over to computer software and strategically
						hiring human marketers for higher-order tasks.

						3 Tips for Creating a Marketing Automation Strategy
					</h4>
				</div>
				<div class="QnA--normal" style="display: block">
					<p>
						As you embark on a marketing automation strategy for your own
						business, keep the following tips in mind.<br/><br/>
						1. Shop around for software. The digital market currently brims
						with marketing automation software. Depending upon your needs,
						you might want software with application programming interface
						(API) capability. Or you might choose a vendor that offers many
						advertising and email templates to help you quickly set up a
						campaign. Compare offerings and don’t waste money on features
						you won’t use.<br/>
						2. Embrace dynamic content. Many marketing automation systems
						can adjust advertising content and landing page content to align
						with real-time web activity. Oftentimes, dynamic content systems
						show entirely different material to people in different
						demographics. This dynamic approach can help marketing
						departments win quality leads by showing customers the right
						content at the right time. It may cost a bit more to acquire
						automated marketing software that provides dynamic content. But
						over time, this extra expense could increase your marketing ROI
						(return on investment).<br/>
						3. Try drip campaigns. A drip campaign is one in which a company
						steadily sends a potential customer automated emails that
						highlight product offerings or perhaps just provide useful
						content. The goal of such marketing activities is to build a
						trusting relationship with the customer. As they become more
						familiar with the brand and learn more about service and product
						offerings, they may be more likely to follow through on a
						purchase.

						Marketing Automation vs. Sales Automation: What’s the
						Difference?
					</h4>
				</div>
				<div class="QnA--normal" style="display: block">
					<p>
						The difference between marketing automation and sales automation
						aligns with the overall difference between marketing and
						sales.<br/><br/>
						Marketing involves building brand awareness. Through outbound
						marketing (like ads and email campaigns) and inbound marketing
						(like SEO and content creation), marketing teams educate
						potential customers about a brand and its offerings. Marketing
						automation runs through marketing automation software. Sales
						involves actual purchases. In a sales relationship, a business
						asks a customer to engage in a financial transaction to purchase
						goods or services. In most customer journeys, a sale comes after
						a marketing campaign; people do not make purchases until they
						become generally acquainted with the vendor. Sales automation
						runs through customer relationship management (CRM) software.<br/><br/>
						Agile marketing teams play out multiple iterations of marketing
						campaigns to constantly analyze metrics and make continuous
						improvements that satisfy customer needs.
