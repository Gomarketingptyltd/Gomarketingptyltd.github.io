						Agile marketing is an adaptive marketing strategy that adjusts
						based on consumer trends and customer needs. The agile
						methodology prizes team members who question structures instead
						of adhering to standard ones. Traditional marketing may build
						off of existing templates and trusted marketing efforts. In
						contrast, an agile marketing approach has frequent check-ins to
						measure key performance indicators (KPIs) while making real-time
						changes to a plan to improve team structure and initiatives.

					<h4 class="QnA--heading">7 Characteristics of Agile Marketing</h4>
				</div>
				<div class="QnA--normal" style="display: block">
					<p>
						The agile marketing manifesto has seven core values:<br/><br/>
						1. Customer-focused collaboration: The end goal for all agile
						frameworks is to prioritize the customer journey and customer
						needs. Marketing teams will place themselves in the customers’
						shoes, optimizing ads, content marketing, and more to best suit
						the customer. Marketers use teamwork in agile marketing—there
						are no silos or hierarchical systems.<br/>
						2. Customer discovery: Agile practices also constantly learn
						more about a target audience or customer demographic. Instead of
						static prediction, agile principles rely on standup meetings to
						reanalyze what teams thought they knew about the consumer,
						employing new findings to refine campaigns.<br/>
						3. Validated learning: The agile approach is more concerned with
						data-driven digital marketing than marketing plans built on
						conventions or assumptions. Agile marketing works best when
						research informs project management, even if new findings in the
						data change mid-project.<br/>
						4. Small experiments: Marketers will deploy multiple small
						campaigns throughout the process. These small experiments are
						often less expensive and more effective than pursuing one
						massive campaign that can sink a team’s time and budget.<br/>
						5. Iterative campaigns: Marketing departments find agile ways to
						deploy multiple campaigns, testing out which ones work best
						instead of executing big-bang campaigns that take ample time and
						resources.<br/>
						6. Flexible planning: In agile marketing, marketers avoid rigid
						planning. Instead, teams encourage new ideas and disruptive
						patterns for experimentation. Teams will try out new marketing
						strategies while ensuring workflow stays consistent for the
						well-being of everyone, from the CMO to a representative.<br/>
						7. Response to change: Agile marketing favors questioning
						tactics, exploring new options, and inviting search engine
						optimization (SEO) or customer data to inform future practices.

					<h4 class="QnA--heading">3 Agile Marketing Frameworks</h4>
				</div>
				<div class="QnA--normal" style="display: block">
					<p>
						There are a few agile marketing frameworks, including the
						following approaches to project management:<br/><br/>
						1. Scrum: Scrum originated as a software development tool but
						marketers also use it for agile marketing campaigns. Scrum is a
						methodology that promotes adaptability, and the basic system
						involves selecting a data set or campaign idea to explore from a
						company’s backlog of content, sprint planning (where sprints are
						the testing of a strategy based on the content at hand),
						iterations where the sprint is public as a campaign, daily
						stand-up meetings to assess the viability of the campaign, and
						then forward action based on what these retrospectives
						illuminate.<br/>
						2. Kanban: There are several moving pieces in agile marketing,
						so some teams will choose to employ a kanban board. While scrum
						focuses on adaptability, kanban leads with transparency. Its
						table shows what actions are at what phase in their lifecycle
						(whose parts may be labeled as “ideation” or “drafted” or
						“live”). Kanban offers a clear system and progression of tasks
						to help teams stay on track and prioritizes a balanced workflow
						as new marketing plans arise.<br/>
						3. Scrumban: Scrumban is a portmanteau of scrum and kanban,
						combining pieces of each framework type. Scrumban uses the
						consistency of scrum’s sprints output while organizing it in
						kanban’s tabular system to keep track of individual tasks and
						processes. Scrumban utilizes daily stand-up meetings, a
						visualized workflow, and consistent retrospectives.

					<h4 class="QnA--heading">4 Benefits of Agile Marketing</h4>
				</div>
				<div class="QnA--normal" style="display: block">
					<p>
						Stakeholders and product owners will find agile marketing to be
						a beneficial strategy because the strategy achieves the
						following:<br/><br/>
						1. Embraces the new. Agile marketing constantly adapts, meaning
						it can be the first strategy to try out cutting-edge
						technologies and practices.<br/>
						2. Uses more precise data. Agile marketers will hold daily
						stand-up meetings to look into consumer trends and market
						research. Marketers use the up-to-date data to adapt the
						campaign for the brand’s benefit.<br/>
						3. Builds stronger customer relationships. Customer satisfaction
						is the end goal of agile marketing, so brands focus on image and
						customer service to prioritize consumers. This improves brand
						loyalty and trust.<br/>
						4. Leads to more sales. Brands that innovate and try new ways to
						attract customers will find their efforts pay off. Employing
						diverse channels and systems can reach new buyers.

						What to Consider Before Starting a Business
					</h4>
				</div>
				<div class="QnA--normal" style="display: block">
					<p>
						Businesses are more than just a clever idea—good business owners
						spend a lot of time developing every aspect of their business
						model to ensure they have all the information they need in order
						to take their idea to the next level. There are four key
						elements that you’ll need to research in detail to figure out if
						your small business idea is a good one:<br/><br/>
						1. Need. Every good start-up business is filling a need; if not,
						there would be no reason for them to exist. You need to think
						thoroughly about what needs your business is filling, and if
						there are enough people who have that need. The value of a
						business can be directly correlated to demand; many businesses
						fail in their first year because they don’t verify that their
						idea has market value.<br/>
						2. Differentiation. A quick Google search will often reveal that
						there are other businesses doing what you want to do. There
						isn’t an unlimited amount of space in a market for businesses
						doing the exact same thing, so it’s crucial that you think about
						what makes your business different than the competition. This is
						called your “unique selling proposition” (or USP), and it’s the
						pitch that you can give to your potential customers to convince
						them that your product or service is uniquely suited to meet
						their needs, as opposed to the other businesses selling similar
						products or services.<br/>
						3. Target market. It’s vital that you determine who your ideal
						customer is: who will be buying your product or service? The
						more specific you can get, the more likely you will understand
						how to design the marketing strategy of your company—think about
						their gender, age, weight, interests, education level,
						lifestyle, occupation, income, and location. If you’re stuck,
						focus groups and surveys can help you better understand the pain
						points of your demographic. Once you’ve narrowed your target
						customers as much as you can, you’ll want to conduct a market
						analysis (also called market research) to determine how big (and
						how saturated) the market is for your product or service.<br/>
						4. Cost. You’ll need to ask yourself how much your business
						structure will require to get started, and how much money you’ll
						need to spend to create each new product or offer each new
						service. This information is essential to know in order to
						calculate your overhead and so you know how big your business
						needs to be in order to create good cash flow. You can also ask
						other cost-related questions: Would your business be a good
						candidate for crowdfunding? Would it require a business credit
						card?
